# Realmpipe [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/dmarcuse/realmpipe.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/dmarcuse/realmpipe)
A fast and lightweight Realm of the Mad God proxy

Written in Rust using asynchronous networking, realmpipe strives to offer high performance with minimal overhead.
It may be used as either a library (`realmpipe_core` and optionally `realmpipe_extractor`), or a standalone binary (`realmpipe_cli`).
